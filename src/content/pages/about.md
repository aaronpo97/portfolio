I am a highly motivated, self-taught developer based in London, ON. My passion for coding
began during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when I decided to acquire new skills and
teach myself how to build applications. Despite having minimal experience at the start of
this journey, I have been dedicated to learning front-end and back-end development. My
determination and hard work have enabled me to become a skilled developer, with experience
in various technologies.

I am still new to the field of software development and I am eager to learn more. I am
looking for opportunities to gain meaningful experience in an environment that can provide
mentorship and guidance. I am also open to learning new methodologies and tools that can
help me become a better developer. I am excited to work on new projects and to collaborate
with other developers to build great software. I am confident that my skills and
determination make me a valuable asset to any team and I look forward to contributing my
abilities to any company that is willing to invest in my growth.
