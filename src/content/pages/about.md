## About Me

I'm a driven, self-taught developer located in London, ON. My coding journey ignited at
the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Following my graduation with a Bachelor of Music from
the University of Western Ontario, I took the initiative to acquire new skills and
independently learn the art of software development.

## Goals

My ultimate goal is to become a Full Stack Developer, proficient in both front-end and
back-end technologies. I am actively seeking opportunities that will allow me to apply my
knowledge in a real-world setting and contribute to meaningful projects.

I am open to collaborations, internships, or entry-level positions where I can further
develop my skills and learn from experienced professionals.

## Interests

I have a strong enthusiasm for staying ahead of industry trends and emerging technologies.
My passion lies in crafting user-friendly and visually captivating applications. I
seamlessly integrate my arts background into problem-solving, relishing the creative
process of transforming ideas into functional software.

Beyond software development, my interests extend to gardening, biking, indulging in
professional wrestling, binge-watching King of the Hill, and immersing myself in a diverse
range of music.

## Technologies

I have hands-on experience with a range of technologies, including but not limited to:

### Front-end

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next.js, TailwindCSS

### Back-end

Node.js, Express.js, Nest.js

### Databases

## Projects

I have worked on several personal projects to apply and showcase my skills. These projects
include web applications, APIs, and more. You can find them here.

## Contact

I am always open to connecting with fellow developers, industry professionals, and
potential collaborators.

Feel free to reach out to me through email or connect with me on LinkedIn. I look forward
to engaging in discussions, sharing insights, and exploring potential opportunities in the
vast world of software development.
